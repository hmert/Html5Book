	<h4>Risk 3: How much damage is done if an attacker finds 
	vulnerabilities in your browser</h4>
	
	<p class="continuation">Some modern browsers like Chrome and 
	Internet Explorer are built with an added layer of protection 
	known as a “sandbox.” Just as a real-life sandbox has walls to 
	keep sand from spilling out, a browser sandbox builds a contained 
	environment to keep malware and other security threats from 
	infecting your computer. If you open a malicious web page, the 
	browser’s sandbox prevents that malicious code from leaving the 
	browser and installing itself to your hard drive. The malicious 
	code therefore cannot read, alter, or further damage the data on 
	your computer.</p>
	
	<p>In summary, a modern browser can protect you against online 
	security threats by first, checking websites you’re about to visit 
	for suspected malware and phishing; second, providing update 
	notifications or auto-updating</p>

<div class="right">
	<p class="continuation">when a newer, more secure version of the 
	browser is available, and third, using the browser sandbox to curb 
	malicious code from causing further damage to your computer.</p>

	<p>In the next few chapters, we’ll take a look at how a basic 
	understanding of web addresses can help you make informed decisions 
	about the websites you visit.</p>
