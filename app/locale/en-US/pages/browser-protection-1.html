<p class="drop-cap">An up-to-date browser guards you from phishing 
and malware attacks when you’re browsing the web. It does so by 
limiting three types of security risk when you’re online:</p>

<h4>Risk 1: How often you come into contact with an attacker</h4>

<p class="continuation">You can be exposed to attackers through a 
malicious fake website, or even through a familiar website that has 
been hacked. Most modern browsers pre-check each web page you visit 
and alert you if one is suspected of being malicious. This lets you 
make an informed judgment about whether you really want to visit 
that page.</p>
