	<p class="continuation">What exactly are phishing and malware attacks?</p>
	<p>Phishing takes place when someone masquerades as someone else, often with a fake website, to trick you into sharing personal information.  (It’s called “phishing” because the bad guys throw out electronic bait and wait for someone to bite.)  In a typical phishing scam, the attacker sends an email that looks like it’s from a bank or familiar web service you use. The subject line might say, “Please update your information at your bank!” The email contains phishing links that look like they go to your bank’s website, but really take you to an impostor website. There you’re asked to log in, and inadvertently reveal your bank account number, credit card numbers, passwords, or other sensitive information to the bad guys.</p>

	<p>Malware, on the other hand, is malicious software installed on your machine, usually without your knowledge.  You may be asked to download an anti-virus software that is actually a virus itself. Or you may visit a page that installs software on your computer without even asking. The software is really designed to steal credit card numbers or passwords from your computer, or in some cases, harm your computer. Once the malware is on your computer, it’s not only difficult to remove, but it’s also free to access all the data and files it finds, send that information elsewhere, and generally wreak havoc on your computer.</p>
