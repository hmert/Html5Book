<div class="left">
	<p class="continuation"> your browser loads a web page, much more data and complex code needs to be processed.</p>
	<p>How much more, and how much more complex? A few astounding statistics:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Images and photos now make up about <strong>65% of the information</strong> on a typical web page, in terms of bytes per page.</li>
		<li><strong>35 hours of video</strong> are uploaded to YouTube every minute of the day. (That’s like Hollywood releasing 130,000 new full-length movies every week, though with less popcorn.)</li>
		<li>JavaScript programs have grown from a few lines to <strong>several hundred kilobytes</strong> of source code that must be processed each time a web page or application loads.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="right">
	<p>So won’t all these gushing floods of data slow down page loads on the browser? Will the Internet clog up and turn to molasses soon?</p>
	<p>Probably not. Images and photos became commonplace on the web when computer scientists found ways to compress them into smaller files that could be sent and downloaded more easily. GIF and JPEG were the most popular of those early file-compression systems. Meanwhile, plug-ins were invented to work around the early limitations of HTML so that video could be embedded and played in web pages.</p>
