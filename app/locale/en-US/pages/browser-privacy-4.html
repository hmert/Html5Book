<p>There’s always a bit of tension between privacy and efficiency.  
Collecting real-world aggregate data and feedback from users can 
really help improve products and the user experience. The key is 
finding a good balance between the two while upholding strong 
privacy standards.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from the real world: browser cookies. On one 
hand, with cookies, a website you frequently visit is able to remember 
contents of your shopping cart, keep you logged in, and deliver a 
more useful, personalized experience based on your previous visits. 
On the other hand, allowing browser cookies means that the website is 
collecting and remembering information about these previous visits. 
If you wish, you can choose to block cookies at any time. So the next 
time you’re curious about fine-tuning your browser privacy settings, 
check out the privacy settings in your browser’s Options or 
Preferences menu.</p>
