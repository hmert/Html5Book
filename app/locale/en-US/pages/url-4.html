	<p>Now let’s talk safety.  One way to check if you’re surfing right into a phishing scam or an impostor website is by looking carefully at the URL in your browser’s address bar.  Pay particular attention to the hostname — remember, only the legitimate owner of that hostname can use it.</p>
	<p>For example, if you click on a link and expect to be directed to the Bank of America website:</p>
	<h4>LEGITIMATE:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>www.<span class="highlight">bankofamerica</span>.com is a legitimate URL, since the hostname is correct.</li>
		<li>www.<span class="highlight">bankofamerica</span>.com/smallbusiness is also a legitimate URL since the hostname is correct. The path of the URL points to a sub-page on small business.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="right">
	<h4>SUSPICIOUS:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="highlight">bankofamerica</span>.xyz.com is not Bank of America’s website. Instead, “bankofamerica” is a subdomain of the website xyz.com.</li>
		<li>www.xyz.com/<span class="highlight">bankofamerica</span> is still not Bank of America's website. Instead, “bankofamerica” is a path within www.xyz.com.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you’re using a banking website or conducting an online transaction with sensitive information such as your password or account number, check the address bar first! Make sure that the scheme is “<strong>https://</strong>” and there’s a padlock icon in your browser’s address bar. “https://” indicates that the data is being transported between the server and browser using a secure connection.</p>
