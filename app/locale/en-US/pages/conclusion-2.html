</div>
<div class="right">
	<p><strong>Use a modern browser,</strong> first and foremost.  Or try a new one and see if it brings you happier browsing that’s better suited to your needs.</p>
	<p><strong>The web will keep evolving — dramatically!</strong>  Support cutting-edge web technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and WebGL, because they’ll help the web community imagine and create a future of great, innovative web apps.</p>
	<p><strong>Lastly, try new things.</strong> The web is a new and exciting place every day, so try tasks that you didn’t think could be done online -- such as researching your ancestry back ten generations, or viewing a real-time webcam image from a climbing basecamp in the Himalayas.  You might be surprised by what you find!</p>
