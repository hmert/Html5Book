	<p>Let’s look more closely at privacy. Here’s an analogy: Say you’re 
	an avid runner who jogs a few miles every day. If you carry a GPS 
	device to help you track your daily runs, you create a diary of 
	running data on your device — a historical record of where you run, 
	how far you run, your average speed, and the calories you burn.</p>
	
	<p>As you browse the web, you generate a similar diary of <i>browser</i> 
	data that is stored locally on your computer: a history of the sites you 
	visit, the cookies sent to your browser, and any files you download. If 
	you’ve asked your browser to remember your passwords or form data, that’s 
	stored on your computer too.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
	<p>Some of us may not realize that we can clear all this browser data 
	from our computers at any time. It’s easy to do through a browser’s 
	Options or Preferences menu. (The menu differs from browser to browser.) 
	In fact, the latest versions of most modern browsers also offer a “private” 
	or “incognito” mode. For example, in Chrome’s incognito mode, any web page 
	that you view won’t appear in your browsing history. In addition, all new 
	cookies are deleted after you close all the incognito windows that you’ve 
	opened. This mode is especially handy if you share your computer with 
	other people, or if you work on a public computer in your local library 
	or cybercafe.</p>
