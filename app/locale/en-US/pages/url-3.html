	<p>It’s easy to take URLs for granted, since we type them into our browsers every day.  But understanding the parts of a URL can help guard against phishing scams or security attacks.</p>
	<p class="continuation">Let’s look at what’s in a URL in this example:</p>
	<div class="url-breakdown">
		<span class="url">http://www.google.com/maps</span>
		<span class="figure-1">scheme</span>
		<span class="figure-2">hostname</span>
		<span class="figure-3">path</span>
		<span class="figure-4">top level domain</span>
	</div>
	<p>The first part of a URL is called the <strong>scheme</strong>. In the example above, HTTP is the scheme and shorthand for HyperText Transfer Protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
	<p>Next, “www.google.com” is the name of the <strong>host</strong> where the website resides. When any person or company creates a new web site, they register this hostname for themselves. Only they may use it. This is important, as we’ll see in a moment.</p>
	<p>A URL may have an additional <strong>path</strong> after the hostname, which sends you to a specific page on that host — like jumping right to a chapter or page in a book. Back to our example, the path tells the host server that you want to see the maps web application at www.google.com. (In other words, Google Maps.)  Sometimes that path is moved to the front of the hostname as a subdomain, such as “maps.google.com”, or “news.google.com” for Google News.</p>
