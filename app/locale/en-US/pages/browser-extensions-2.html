	<p>Browser extensions can also act on their own, outside of web pages. 
	An email notifier extension can live on your browser toolbar, quietly 
	check for new messages in your email account and let you know when one 
	arrives. In this case, the extension is always working in the 
	background no matter what web page you’re looking at — and you don’t 
	have to log in to your email in a separate window to see if you have 
	new messages.</p>

	<p>When browser extensions were first introduced, developers often had 
	to build them in unusual programming languages or in heavy-duty 
	mainstream languages like C++. This took a lot of work, time and 
	expertise. Adding more code to the browser also added to security 
	concerns, as it gave attackers more chances to exploit the browser. 
	Because the code was sometimes arcane, extensions were notorious for 
	causing browser crashes, too.</p>
	
	<p>Today, most browsers let developers write extensions in the basic, 
	friendly programming languages of the web: HTML, JavaScript and CSS. 
	Those are the same languages used to build most modern web apps and web 
	pages, so today’s extensions are much closer cousins to the web apps and 
	pages they work with. They’re faster and easier to build, safer, and get 
	better and better right along with the web standards they’re built upon.</p>
